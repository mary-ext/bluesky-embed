This custom element is available on npm.

```
npm install bluesky-post-embed
```

Then, import the package on your app.

```js
import 'bluesky-post-embed';
```

### via CDN

If you like, you can also rely on CDN services like JSDelivr.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://esm.run/bluesky-post-embed"></script>
```

## Basic usage

Bluesky posts can be embedded like so:

```html
<bluesky-post src="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3kj2umze7zj2n" theme="light">
	<blockquote class="bluesky-post-fallback">
		<p dir="auto">angel mode</p>
		&mdash; Paul Frazee ðŸ¦‹ (@pfrazee.com)
		<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3kj2umze7zj2n">January 16, 2024</a>
	</blockquote>
</bluesky-post>
```

Adding a fallback content like above is heavily recommended for progressive enhancement.
